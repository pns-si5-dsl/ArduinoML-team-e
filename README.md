# ArduinoML - Team E

**Course:** Domain Specific Languages

**Professor:** J. Deantoni

**Date:** January 2022 - February 2022

## I. Description

The goal of this project is to implement the ArduinoML language which allows coding simple applications for [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).
It defines an embedded DSL implemented in [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/) and an external DSL built using the [AntLR](https://www.antlr.org/) framework.

## II. Kernel

The kernel of our two languages was implemented in [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/) and defines the following domain model:

## III. Embedded DSL

### 1. Description

The embedded DSL was implemented in [Java](https://www.java.com/fr/).

### 2. Usage

In order to build your own application, you just need to create a class annotated with the `@ArduinoML()` annotation and extend the [EmbeddedApplication](./src/main/java/embedded/builders/EmbeddedApplication.java) class.

Then, the attributes annotated with the `@Input()` and `@Output()` annotations allow to define the sensors and actuators used by the application.

Finally, the methods define the states of the application. 
To define the initial state of the application, you just have to annotate one of the states of the application with the `@Initial()` annotation.
Within these methods, it is possible to use the `set()`, `when()` and `after()` methods to define various actions or transitions.

```java
@ArduinoML(name = "my-app")
public class MyApplication extends EmbeddedApplication {
    @Input(pin = 8)
    Sensor button;

    @Output(pin = 12)
    Actuator led;

    @Initial
    void off() {
        set(led).to(LOW);
        when(button).is(HIGH).then("on");
    }

    void on() {
        set(led).to(HIGH);
        when(button).is(HIGH).then("off");
    }
}
```

### 3. Execution

In order to run your application and get the corresponding Arduino code, you can add a `main()` method to your application with the following code:

```java
@ArduinoML(name = "my-app")
public class MyApplication extends EmbeddedApplication {
    // ==========
    // Code here.
    // ==========
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Build my app.
        App app = new MyApplication().build();

        // Translate my app.
        Visitor<StringBuffer> codeGenerator = new Generator();
        app.accept(codeGenerator);

        // Print the translation.
        System.out.println(codeGenerator.getGeneratedCode());
    }
} 
```

### 4. Examples

- You can find a set of usage examples in the [`embedded.examples`](src/main/java/embedded/examples) package.

- You can compile all examples with Gradle:

```sh 
gradle compileEmbeddedDslExamples
```

> All application classes located in the [`embedded.examples`](src/main/java/embedded/examples) package will be executed and the resulting Arduino `.ino` files will be placed in the `./out` folder.

## IV. External DSL

### 1. Description

The external DSL was built using the [AntLR](https://www.antlr.org/) framework.
Its grammar is located in the file [`ArduinoML.g4`](src/main/java/external/antlr/ArduinoML.g4)
and all other files in the same directory were generated by AntLR from the grammar.
The class [`ModelBuilder`](src/main/java/external/arduinoML/builder/ModelBuilder.java) is a listener allowing to build an instance
of the Domain Model by browsing an AST of our DSL.
The class [`Main`](src/main/java/external/Main.java) allows to compile a text file written in our DSL into an `.ino` file.  

### 2. Usage

```
Sensor button on PIN8
Actuator led on PIN12

initial ledOff {
    led is LOW
    when button is HIGH then ledOn
}

ledOn {
    led is HIGH
    when button is HIGH then ledOff
}
```

### 3. Execution

To run the external DSL, you have to execute `src/main/java/external/Main.java` passing it 2 arguments:

- The path of the file to compile
- The name of the output file

Then, a `.ino` file (named as you wished) will be created in the source file directory.  

### 4. Examples

- You can find a set of usage examples in the [`external.examples`](src/main/java/external/examples) package.

### 5. Syntax highlighting

If you want to add syntax highlighting when editing a file in the ArduinoML DSL,
you can easily import a customised **TextMate Bundle** we made in your favorite IDE.
That TextMate only works for files with a `.aml` extension.

#### a. JetBrains

- Navigate to `Settings > Plugins > Installed`, and make sure the `TextMate Bundles` plugin is installed and enabled. This plugin is usually already installed.
- Navigate to `Settings > Editor > TextMate bundles`, and click the `+` button to add a new TextMate bundle.
- Select this folder located within this project.
- Click OK to apply the changes.
- Syntax highlighting will be automatically applied to files with the `.aml` extension.

#### b. VS Code

- Copy the folder `plugins/arduino-ml` inside the `.vscode/extensions` folder.
- Syntax highlighting will be automatically applied to files with the `.aml` extension.

#### c. Other text editors

I let you Google how to install a TextMate Bundle on your favorite text editor :^)
